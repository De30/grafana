# Silences

Use silences to stop notifications from one or more alerting rules. Silences do not prevent alert rules from being evaluated. They also do not stop alert instances from being shown in the user interface. Silences only stop notifications from getting created. A silence lasts for only a specified window of time.

You can configure Grafana managed silences as well as silences for an external Alertmanager data source.
