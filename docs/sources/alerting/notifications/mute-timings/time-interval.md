# Mute time interval

A time interval is a definition for a moment in time. If an alert fires during this interval it will be suppressed. All fields are lists, and at least one list element must be satisfied to match the field. Fields also support ranges using `:` (ex: `monday:thursday`). The fields available for a time interval are: mute timing can contain multiple time intervals. A time interval is a specific duration when alerts are suppressed from firing. The duration typically consists of a specific time range along with days of a week, month, or year.

    All properties for the time interval are lists, and at least one list element must be satisfied to match the field. The fields support ranges using `:` (ex: `monday:thursday`). If you leave a field blank, it will match with any moment of time.

Supported time interval options are:

- Time range: The time inclusive of the starting time and exclusive of the end time in UTC. - Days of the week: The day or range of days of the week. Example: `monday:thursday`. - Days of the month: The date 1-31 of a month. Negative values can also be used to represent days that begin at the end of the month. For example: `-1` for the last day of the month. - Months: The months of the year in either numerical or the full calendar month. For example: `1, may:august`. - Years: The year or years for the interval. For example: `2021:2024`.

If a field is left blank, any moment of time will match the field. For an instant of time to match a complete time interval, all fields must match. A mute timing can contain multiple time intervals.

If you want to specify an exact duration, specify all the options. For example, if you wanted to create a time interval for the first Monday of the month, for March, June, September, and December, between the hours of 12:00 and 24:00 UTC your time interval specification would be:

- Time range:
  - Start time: `12:00`
  - End time: `24:00`
- Days of the week: `monday`
- Months: `3, 6, 9, 12`
- Days of the month: `1:7`
